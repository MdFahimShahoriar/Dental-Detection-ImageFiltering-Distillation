## üìÑ Overview
Root canal treatment is a critical dental procedure aimed at saving natural teeth by removing infected pulp. Detecting the stages of root canal treatments accurately can significantly improve patient outcomes. Our project **enhances the detection of root canal stages by combining image filtering techniques with advanced deep learning models (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8)**. Utilizing **knowledge distillation** and a dataset of over **1600 annotated dental radiographs**, we‚Äôve developed a powerful tool for dental practitioners and researchers alike.

This repository includes:
- Comparative results of various **image filtering techniques** (Mean, Median, Contourlet, Bayesian, Gaussian, BM3D, and Non-Local Means)
- Deep learning models trained with **YOLO architectures** (YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8)
- Enhanced performance through **knowledge distillation**
- Evaluation metrics, code samples, and more

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Dental-ImageFiltering-DeepLearning-Distillation.git
    cd Dental-ImageFiltering-DeepLearning-Distillation
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    We recommend using a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download the Dataset**:
    - Follow the instructions in the `data/README.md` to download and preprocess the dataset.

## üìà Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing
Prepare the dataset by applying the chosen image filtering techniques. Each filter method can be executed independently based on the dataset:
```python
from utils.image_filters import apply_filter

# Example usage
filtered_image = apply_filter("path/to/image.jpg", method="gaussian")
```

### 2. Model Training
Train YOLO models on filtered datasets using `YOLOv5`, `YOLOv7`, or `YOLOv8` architectures:
```bash
python train.py --model yolov5 --dataset /path/to/filtered_data
```

### 3. Knowledge Distillation
Leverage our knowledge distillation script to enhance model accuracy:
```bash
python knowledge_distillation.py --teacher_model yolov8 --student_model yolov5
```

### 4. Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance:
bash
python evaluate.py --model yolov5 --dataset /path/to/test_data
